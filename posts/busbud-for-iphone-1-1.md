I’ve been working with the Busbud team to improve the experience of their iPhone app, and version 1.1 will be available later today for download on the App Store with an updated search form and improved search results, as well as some UI refinements. The Busbud iPhone app <mark>lets you search for bus itineraries</mark> between cities and choose which one is best for you. Best of all: it’s currently supported for over 4000 cities around the world and 13 languages. It’s the perfect app for bus travellers.

We still have a lot of good stuff coming up for the app and the website, so make sure to keep an eye on both.
