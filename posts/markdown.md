## Hi, I’m Ramy. Welcome to my home online.

I hail from Montréal, Canada where I studied graphic design and developed a strong interest technology, design, and editorial photography very early on.

I have spent the last 8 years building digital products and apps at companies like Square, Codecademy, Citymaps (acquired by TripAdvisor in 2016), Busbud, and the National Film Board of Canada. Currently, I am a Product Designer at Glossier, building brand new experiences for the beauty world. Products and contributions of mine have been highlighted by publications such as Fast Company, Fonts in Use, CBC/Radio-Canada, Condé; Nast, Inc, and Y Combinator.

As a photographer, I’ve been consistently creating personal work for the past 10 years — with a strong focus on editorial and travel photography — and have seen some of it published by Forbes, Yahoo Finance, and Built in NYC.

All the styles yo. My favorite keyboard shortcut is <kbd>⌘ + Shift + Alt + 8</kbd>. Make sure to do `npm install` to lorem ipsum dolor.

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this

```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```
